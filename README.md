# About

This repo contains the lexicons for the `games.gamesgamesgamesgames.*` namespace. These lexicons provide a unified structure for game developers to store data in ATProto repositories. By providing a unified namespace we enable an array of applications to tap into that data for a host of purposes, from providing users with a trophy case to show off their achievements across games, to a directory of all games on ATProto.

## Usage

To use these lexicons in your ATProto application, reference the namespace `games.gamesgamesgamesgames.*` in your code. For more information on consuming lexicons, see the [ATProto Lexicon Guide](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon).
